class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String args[]){
    String name = "Rohit";
    System.out.println(name.substring(0));
    } 
}
// Output: Rohit
// Explanation: The substring() method returns a new string that is a substring of this string
. The substring begins with the character at the specified index and extends to the end of this string.
In this case, the substring begins with the character at index 0 and extends to the end of the string "Rohit", 
so the output is "Rohit".
