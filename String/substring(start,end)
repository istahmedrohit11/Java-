class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String args[]){
    String name = "Rohit";
    System.out.println(name.substring(0, 2));
    } 
}
// Output: Ro
// Explanation: The substring() method is used to extract a part of a string.
//  It takes two arguments, the starting index and the ending index (exclusive)
//   of the substring to be extracted. In this case, the substring() method is 
//   used to extract the first two characters of the string "Rohit", which 
//   are "Ro". The extracted substring is then printed to the console using 
//   the println() method.
